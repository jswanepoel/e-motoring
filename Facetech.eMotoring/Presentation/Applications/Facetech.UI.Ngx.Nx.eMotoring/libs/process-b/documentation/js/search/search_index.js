applications.\nNx is designed to help you create and build enterprise grade Angular applications. It provides an opinionated approach to application project structure and patterns.\nQuick Start & Documentation\nWatch a 5-minute video on how to get started with Nx.\nGenerate your first application\nRun ng generate app myapp to generate an application. When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same CLI workspace. Read more here.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve --project=myapp for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name --project=myapp to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build --project=myapp to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nBefore running the tests make sure you are serving the app via ng serve.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules - modules","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n    Modules\n\n\n    \n            \n                \n                    \n                        ProcessBModule\n                    \n                    \n                                \n                                    \n                                        Your browser does not support SVG\n                                    \n                                \n                        \n                            Browse\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n    Overview\n\n  \n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n\ndependencies\n\nLegend\n\n  Declarations\n\n  Module\n\n  Bootstrap\n\n  Providers\n\n  Exports\n\ncluster_ProcessBModule\n\n\n\ncluster_ProcessBModule_declarations\n\n\n\ncluster_ProcessBModule_exports\n\n\n\ncluster_ProcessBModule_providers\n\n\n\n\nBuyerDocumentManagerComponent\n\nBuyerDocumentManagerComponent\n\n\n\nProcessBModule\n\nProcessBModule\n\nProcessBModule -->\n\nBuyerDocumentManagerComponent->ProcessBModule\n\n\n\n\n\nBuyerInformationCaptureComponent\n\nBuyerInformationCaptureComponent\n\nProcessBModule -->\n\nBuyerInformationCaptureComponent->ProcessBModule\n\n\n\n\n\nBuyerLimitedInformationCaptureComponent\n\nBuyerLimitedInformationCaptureComponent\n\nProcessBModule -->\n\nBuyerLimitedInformationCaptureComponent->ProcessBModule\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplayVehicleInformationComponent\n\nDisplayVehicleInformationComponent\n\nProcessBModule -->\n\nDisplayVehicleInformationComponent->ProcessBModule\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdateVehicleInformationComponent\n\nUpdateVehicleInformationComponent\n\nProcessBModule -->\n\nUpdateVehicleInformationComponent->ProcessBModule\n\n\n\n\n\nVehicleStatusComponent\n\nVehicleStatusComponent\n\nProcessBModule -->\n\nVehicleStatusComponent->ProcessBModule\n\n\n\n\n\nBuyerDocumentManagerComponent \n\nBuyerDocumentManagerComponent \n\nBuyerDocumentManagerComponent  -->\n\nProcessBModule->BuyerDocumentManagerComponent \n\n\n\n\n\nBuyerInformationCaptureComponent \n\nBuyerInformationCaptureComponent \n\nBuyerInformationCaptureComponent  -->\n\nProcessBModule->BuyerInformationCaptureComponent \n\n\n\n\n\nBuyerLimitedInformationCaptureComponent \n\nBuyerLimitedInformationCaptureComponent \n\nBuyerLimitedInformationCaptureComponent  -->\n\nProcessBModule->BuyerLimitedInformationCaptureComponent \n\n\n\n\n\nDisplayVehicleInformationComponent \n\nDisplayVehicleInformationComponent \n\nDisplayVehicleInformationComponent  -->\n\nProcessBModule->DisplayVehicleInformationComponent \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdateVehicleInformationComponent \n\nUpdateVehicleInformationComponent \n\nUpdateVehicleInformationComponent  -->\n\nProcessBModule->UpdateVehicleInformationComponent \n\n\n\n\n\nVehicleStatusComponent \n\nVehicleStatusComponent \n\nVehicleStatusComponent  -->\n\nProcessBModule->VehicleStatusComponent \n\n\n\n\n\nProcessBService\n\nProcessBService\n\nProcessBModule -->\n\nProcessBService->ProcessBModule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        Zoom in\n        Reset\n        Zoom out\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        1 Module\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    6 Components\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    1 Injectable\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    2 Interfaces\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
