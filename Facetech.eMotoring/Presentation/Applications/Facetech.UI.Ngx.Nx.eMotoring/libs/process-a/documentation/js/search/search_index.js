It provides an opinionated approach to application project structure and patterns.\nQuick Start & Documentation\nWatch a 5-minute video on how to get started with Nx.\nGenerate your first application\nRun ng generate app myapp to generate an application. When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same CLI workspace. Read more here.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve --project=myapp for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name --project=myapp to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build --project=myapp to build the project.
